Visit these URLs to see how it works:
- /organizations.json 
- /organizations/acme/people.json
- /organizations/ACME/people/1.json
- /organizations/REX/people/2.json

Differences from Tastypie
- url routing is entirely manual, no magic
- show/create/update/destroy methods (stolen from Rails)
  that return a data structure (e.g. a dict)
- separate collection resources
- no ?format arg, but .<format> appended to routes
  (Although using Accepts should still be encouraged.)

Any other differences (e.g. no Meta, no hydrate/dehydrate)
purely for the sake of being able to quickly put together
a prototype.
